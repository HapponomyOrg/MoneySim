    "# An alternative general-purpose money supply model for a future-proof sustainable economy  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Stef Kuypers PhD researcher VUB  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Abstract  \n",
    "It has been fifty years since the publication of the Club of Rome's book \"Limits to Growth\" (Meadows and Club of Rome, 1972) and over the years the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has published numerous reports indicating ever higher urgency for a transition to a more sustainable economy; that is, an economy which fulfills the needs of the current generation without jeopardizing the well-being of future generations. Progress in this direction is still deemed to be too slow. Lack of funding, conflicting economic interests, and perceived negative impacts of needed measures on the economy are often the cause of delayed, and limited action.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper proposes an alternative general-purpose money supply model with the goal to expand the current set of viable monetary models, introduce a new behavioral economic context, and to be a starting point for further research. It is the intent of the author to open up new paths of thought and reasoning that might have the potential to help solve some of the most pressing challenges society faces today, such as creating a systemically stable foundation for a future-oriented global economy, resolving funding issues for large-scale transition projects that are necessary to mitigate the issues highlighted by the IPCC in a timely manner, and nudge society towards an inherently sustainable economic model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed money supply model is subjected to a series of stress scenarios to determine systemic stability, and the long-term effects of these scenarios are analyzed. Systemic stability is compared with the findings presented in Kuypers et al. (2021). Finally, optional adjustments to the model are discussed, along with the assumed positive effects towards sustainability on a macroeconomic scale. These effects are then compared with the effects of a post-Keynesian money supply model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion is that, although further research will be necessary to address questions raised by this paper, the alternative model shows adequate merit, and there is a significant likelihood that it might be more suitable to support a sustainable economy than the current, post-Keynesian, model. Excessive wealth hoarding and short term capitalization are discouraged, thereby incentivizing a higher focus on long term planning, which is a better basis for sustainable business practices. It gives employees better bargaining power for meaningful jobs. The model provides a self-stabilizing money stock, and therefore provides more financial resilience to large economic shocks such as a global pandemic. Furthermore, the model allows for funding of large-scale projects, such as an energy transition and climate change measures, with a reduced probability to jeopardize monetary, and financial stability."

    "## 1 Introduction  \n",
    "There is by now a widely accepted consensus that our economy needs to transition towards a more sustainable model that provides the physical and psychological needs for the current generation without jeopardizing the well-being of future generations. The most recent IPCC reports (IPCC, 2018; IPCC, 2019; IPCC, 2022) list a plethora of actions that need to be taken in order to make sure this transition is not only ecologically, but also socially sustainable. This is a difficult puzzle to solve considering there are often conflicting economic interests at play (Sornarajah, 2003).\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last few decades, the banking and financial sector has created several tools that should help money to be steered towards sustainable activities. Green investments are marketed as supporting business practices that have a favorable impact on our natural environment. Green finance (Batrancea et al., 2020) provides the tools and constructs that make it easy for ecologically aware investors to find their way, and green banks position themselves as sustainable finance hubs that pledge to stay away from any activities with a negative impact on our living environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, greenwashing pollutes these efforts (Alves, 2009; Lyon and Montgomery, 2015; Banerjee et al., 1995; Chen and Chang, 2013; TerraChoice, 2009, 2010), and would require a substantial, and expensive, auditing effort to keep it under control.\n",
    "Environmental protection legislation by states often triggers lawsuits by investors setting up legal cases through the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) (Miles and Lawry-White, 2019; Hippolyte, 2017). The rulings of the ICSID have a high enforceability (Borlini and Silingardi, 2021), but it has also received critique on its effectiveness (Pauwelyn, 2015; Kahn et al, 2021; Faure and Ma, 2020), and probably needs a reform (Torres Rojas, 2019; You, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents of green growth (OECD, 2011; OECD, 2012; Bowen and Hepburn, 2014) advocate economic growth is needed in order to maintain prosperity and lift people in developing countries out of poverty. Opponents state that sustained economic growth cannot go hand in hand with a reduced impact on our environment (Hickel, 2019; Parrique et al., 2019), and that new models for well-being and prosperity need to be developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the debate is still ongoing, it seems that openness for a reconsideration of our economic growth model is on the rise (OECD, 2020; D’Alessandro et al., 2020). Implementing green growth is not a straightforward endeavor. A combination of adequate accounting methods, political will to implement green policies, which often come with a cost over the short term, and economic incentives for green investments is needed (Hallegatte et al., 2012; Nordhaus, 2015; Hepburn et al., 2018; Larissa et al., 2020; Dogaru, 2021; Batrancea et al., 2020; Peterson, 2021). This is a slow process, and according to a recent United Nations report (United Nations, 2022) there is no credible pathway to limit global warming to 1.5C. \n",
    "\n",
    "A question this paper wants to put on the table is whether finding funds to do what needs to be done, without creating financial instability, really needs to be this hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite strong indications that the current economic growth model has a high likelihood of causing severe problems for future generations (Club of Rome, 1972; Parrique et al., 2019), comparatively little action to mitigate these problems has been undertaken since this knowledge became available in 1972. Arguments against taking action have mostly been based on economic factors and have been strongly influenced by economic interests. Lietaer et al. (2012) have indicated that there is a causal link to the current post-Keynesian money supply model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current monetary and banking system regularly suffers from systemic crises (Laeven and Valencia, 2018). These happen despite the fact that the task of assuring financial stability has been assigned to either central banks, and/or supporting institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical research shows that loans with interest, a key feature of the post-Keynesian money supply model, invariably lead to unpayable debts when there is low to zero economic growth (Hartley and Kallis, 2021). The simulations in Kuypers et al. (2021) reveal that these unpayable debts are a systemic aspect of a debt-based monetary model where the growth of the money stock is slower than the net wealth accumulation of the credit providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complementary currencies, which aim to achieve sustainable economic dynamics, have been studied at length (Fisher et al., 1933; Lietaer, 2011; Groppa, 2013; Gómez and Knorringa, 2016; Vallet, 2018; Gawthorpe, 2019; Kokabian, 2020; Gelleri, 2021; Gelleri and Stodder, 2021). Although there are clear indications that these complementary currencies can successfully steer economic behavior into a more sustainable direction, their impact remains small. The Bristol pound (Johnson and Harvey-Wilson, 2017; Marshall and O’Neill, 2018), one of the more successful complementary currencies, was, at the time when the paper currency was taken out of circulation, only used by 1500 users, of which 650 were businesses. In a city that has a population of well over 450,000 inhabitants, this is a very low percentage. The Sardex (Bazzani, 2021), which was founded in 2010, has currently enlisted approximately 3200 Sardinian businesses according to data provided by the P2P Foundation[^1]. This is about 3.2% of the total number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, although complementary currencies have been proven to create more sustainable economic practices, their impact is too small to solve the transition problem within the time required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thesis is that, in order to speed up the transition towards a sustainable economy, the current post-Keynesian monetary system (Nayan et al., 2013; McLeay et al., 2014; Werner, 2014, 2016; Deutsche Bundesbank, 2017; Gross and Sienenbrunner, 2019) itself needs to be replaced by a new model. This paper introduces such a model and focuses on both systemic stability and its suitability to fund large transition projects. These aspects are compared to the current model. Afterwards, a series of plausible assumptions are presented that can serve as a starting point for further research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new money supply model is constructed from the ground up. First a mathematical description of the model is presented. Alongside this mathematical model, a Stock Flow Consistent (SFC) agent-based model is implemented. The output of this model is compared to the predictions of the mathematical model. Then a system stability analysis is performed for various theoretical scenarios, which are linked to sustainable transition projects where possible. Systemic stability of the model is defined as having a bounded money stock where the bounds can be deduced from the parameters of the model, regardless of the actions of account holders.  \n",

    "## 2 Model description  \n",
    "The model combines two existing concepts, namely a universal basic income (UBI) and demurrage. The idea of a UBI, which is to give every citizen an unconditional fixed income, was first formally introduced by Thomas More in his book Utopia, a fictional story, which was published in 1516. Later, the idea was picked up by several political movements. Throughout recent history, several experiments have been set up around the idea (Osterkamp, 2013; Calnitsky, 2016; Kangas et al., 2019), but it has so far not been permanently implemented. Practical implementation within the current monetary model faces the problem of funding the UBI through taxes. The proposed model solves this problem by creating the money for the UBI ex nihilo. In the current post-Keynesian supply model, money is always someone's liability because it is created from debt, but with alternative money creation methods this can change. Bitcoin, for example, is considered to be an example of a liability free currency (Nerurkar et. al, 2021; Makarova, 2018; Ram, 2019; Nabilou, 2021). The model presented in this paper starts with the assumption that money can be a pure asset without needing to be someone's liability. When presenting this on a balance sheet, it follows that money on someone's account contributes 100% to their equity; see Figure 1.\n",

    "|------|-----------|\n",
    "|Money: 100|Equity: 100|\n",
    "\n",
    " Figure 1 - Asset money balance sheet\n",
    "\n",
    "The term 'basic' in Universal Basic Income adds an aspect to the term that the author of this paper deems limiting. It seems to indicate that the income should cover basic living costs, but not more. This paper does not want to add any indication about how high or how low this income should be, and therefore the more neutral term guaranteed income (GI) is used.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second concept, demurrage, is implemented as a tax on account balances. This idea comes from the work of Silvio Gesell (Gesell, 1958; Svensson and Westermark, 2020) and the stamp scrip money based on his ideas (Champ, 2008). In the presented model, the money collected through demurrage is destroyed. A fixed guaranteed income in combination with a fixed demurrage percentage, in the long run, inevitably converges to a balance between money creation and destruction, thereby guaranteeing calculable boundaries to the money stock."

    "### 2.1 Core model  \n",
    "The core money supply model is constructed in such a way that each cycle a predictable amount of new money is created and a predictable amount of money is destroyed. Creation happens by the system, which can be controlled by a central bank, a government or even managed as a societal common good. The controlling entity deposits a fixed guaranteed income on each $GI$ eligible account. Each living individual holds exactly one $GI$ eligible account. Destruction of money happens by charging demurrage on all existing accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real economy people often hold more than one account and even share accounts with others. The model supports this. All these other accounts are non-eligible and do not receive $GI$, Demurrage is calculated on the total balance of the accounts held by an individual. For shared accounts, the balance is split among the account holders and added to their total balance for the purpose of demurrage calculation. Demurrage is then proportionally deducted from the accounts, both eligible, and non-eligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamics of the model gives rise to a net guaranteed income per period ($NGI_n$) for every individual, that is equal to the guaranteed income minus demurrage, if any. This net guaranteed income becomes negative if demurrage becomes higher than the guaranteed income. This may appear odd, but it eradicates one of the criticisms on UBI, namely that money is given to people who do not need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses are usually separate legal entities and hold their own accounts. All these accounts are non-eligible and all accounts from a business are linked together in the same way the accounts of individuals are linked together.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remainder of this paper, all actors hold exactly one account. This has no influence on the workings of the model since multiple accounts held by the same actor can be grouped together as one virtual account, and demurrage is calculated on the sum of the balances. A shared account is equivalent to a number of accounts, equal to the number of account holders, that each have a share of the balance of the shared account."

Such an account can be either active or inactive. Inactive accounts are still subject to demurrage, and inactive eligible accounts still receive $NGI_n$.

    "#### 2.1.3 Dynamics of the model  \n",
    "After determining $GI$ and $d$, the model needs to be initialized by setting the account balances. The initial account balances can be set to any amount. The sum of all account balances is the initial money stock $M_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this initial step and for each subsequent period, an arbitrary number of monetary transactions between individual accounts can occur. These transactions cannot bring an account balance below 0. Therefore, a transaction amount from account $a_x$ to account $a_y \\le max(0, B_t(a_x))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of each period $P_n$, including the first one, demurrage is calculated for each account. Then, $NGI_n$ is deposited/subtracted on/from each eligible account and $D_n$ is subtracted from each non-eligible account:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\forall n \\gt 0, \\forall a \\in A_{GI}, B_{T(n)}(a) \\rightarrow B_{T(n)}(a) + NGI_n(a)$  \n",

    "\n",
    "The following conclusions can be drawn:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) All accounts with a constant periodic income ($I$) converge to a calculable upper limit. This is called the $telo$ with parameters $I$, and $d$, notated as $telo(I, d)$. It is the point where $D_n(a) = I$.  \n",
    "For eligible accounts, the income $I$ consists of $GI$ plus surplus income ($IE$). For these accounts, $telo(I, d) is where $NGI$ = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\forall a \\in A, \\lim_{t \\to \\inf}B_t(a) = \\frac{I}{d} = telo(I, d)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This holds regardless of the initial balance of the account. Should the account be initialized with a balance that is higher than $telo(I, d)$, then $D_n(a) > I$ until the balance reaches $telo(I, d)$. When the initial balance is below $telo(I, d)$, then $D_n(a) < I$ until the balance reaches $telo(I, d)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) All accounts without an income converge to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\forall a \\in A, I = 0, \\lim_{t \\to \\inf}B_t(a) = \\frac{I}{d} = \\frac{0}{d} = 0 = telo(0, d)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) From (1) and (2) it can be concluded that, if no transactions occur, and thus the income for all non-eligible accounts is $0$, and the income for all eligible accounts is $GI$, the money stock converges to $|A_{GI}| * telo(GI, d)$, and remains there.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lim_{t\\to \\inf}M_t$ = $|A_{GI}| * \\frac{GI}{d} = |A_{GI}| * telo(GI, d)$\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) The only effect transactions have is to redistribute money among accounts. This affects demurrage on all accounts involved in the transactions, but has no influence on the amount of money being created through $GI$. It can be demonstrated that the total amount of demurrage charged remains the same, regardless of the number of accounts and transactions occurring between accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $M = telo(GI, d) * |A_{GI}|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of transactions $TR$ equals 0 over all $P$, then the statement holds according to (3).\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is one transaction $T_{xy} between $a_x$ and $a_y$ then the following holds:\n",
    "\n",
    "$B(a_x) \\rightarrow B(a_x) - T_{xy}, B(a_y) \\rightarrow B(a_y) + T_{xy}$  \n",
    "$\\Rightarrow D(a_x) = d (B(a_x) - T_{xy}), D(a_y) = d (B(a_y) + T_{xy})$  \n",
    "$\\Rightarrow D(a_x) = d B(a_x) - d T_{xy}, D(a_y) = d B(a_y) + d T_{xy}$  \n",
    "$\\Rightarrow M \\rightarrow M - d T_{xy} + d T_{xy} = M$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the statement already holds for 0 transactions according to (3), only the demurrage calculated on the amount of the transaction needs to be taken into account. This demurrage is subtracted from $D(a_x)$ and is added to $D(a_y)$, resulting in a null operation for $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the statement holds for $TR = n$ over all $P$ and that $T_{xy}$ is a transaction amount for transaction $n + 1$ between randomly selected accounts $a_x$ and $a_y$ then the same logic as for the first transaction can be applied.\n",
    "\n",

    "$\\lim_{t \\to \\inf}, M_t = telo(GI, d) * |A_{GI}|$\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means all accounts are bounded.\n",

However, $IE_x$ does have an influence on the height of the boundary for the account. When this income/expense fluctuates over time, the target bound also fluctuates and this can cause the balance of the account to move towards but never reach the theoretical bound."

    "Rather than having a flat demurrage, demurrage tiers can be introduced, similar to income tax brackets. This also introduces a lower and upper bound for the money stock, similar to the case with demurrage-free buffers. If all money sits in one account, most of it would be subjected to the highest demurrage tier. If all money is evenly distributed, less money would be subjected to the higher demurrage tiers. These two extremes define the upper and lower bounds of the money stock. The exact size of the money stock is dependent on the distribution of the money.\n",

    "The proposed model guarantees a bounded money stock, within predictable bounds, which scales with the number of $GI$-eligible account holders. Depending on the chosen implementation (core model, demurrage-free buffer and/or tiered demurrage), the money stock is either exactly calculable or fluctuates between calculable boundaries. Higher $GI$ increases the money stock while higher $d$ decreases it. The number of $GI$-eligible accounts is determined by the size of the population. Henceforth, $GI$, $d$, and in case a demurrage-free buffer is used, $DF$ are the two/three control parameters for the model.\n",

Excess money creation and/or destruction are countered by the dynamics of the model itself, and even when these events take on a structural character, new bounds for the money stock can be calculated. The time needed before these new bounds are reached depend on $d$. Higher $d$ reduces the time of the transition period. External interventions to stabilize the model, bringing the money stock within predictable boundaries, are only needed in the extreme cases when either the amount of injected newly created money permanently increases each period, or when the constant destruction of money is higher than $|A_GI| * GI$.\n",

Even within this much-studied context, predicting inflation remains difficult. The inflation wave that started around July 2021 was expected to be a temporary issue that would not last long. The war between Russia and Ukraine worsened matters. Central banks raised interest rates, the standard tool against inflation. Models predicted a return to the desired 2% inflation rate within foreseeable time. Inflation did start going down, but not evenly across all sectors. January 2024 data from Statbel[^2], the Belgian statistical office, shows a wide variety of year-over-year inflation numbers that range from -51.9% for natural gas to +50.9% for fresh seafood. Economists acknowledge these are uncharted waters, and it is thus prudent to be prepared for further unexpected shocks.\n",

This is in contrast with the current post-Keynesian money supply model where the money stock can always be expanded, either by supplementary loans or through quantitative easing. This limits the conditions that can cause inflation, based on conclusions drawn from the formula for the velocity of money.  \n",

    "In the proposed model, the money stock is bounded, and can not be the cause of an increase in price level. Continuous inflation, if it occurs, must thus go hand in hand with a decrease in transactions while the velocity of money does not decline accordingly, or a stagnation of the number of transactions going hand in hand with an increase of the velocity of money. These scenarios could be caused by a supply shock where supply can no longer meet demand. However, since the operating context for economic agents, created by the proposed model, is vastly different compared to the context that exists today, no hard conclusions can be drawn on the likelihood of this situation to occur. More research is required to provide a definite answer to that question."

    "##### II. Demand pull  \n",
    "When demand for a product or service increases, prices for that product tend to go up. This is especially the case when demand surpasses supply. When a seller receives more net profit for the same product/service, that profit can, in the current model, be stored in an account, and a reserve can be built. However, with the proposed model, money in that reserve does not amount to the total accumulation of the extra net profit. Let $NP$ be the net profit, which is price minus cost and taxes, per sale of a product or service, and let $R$ be the surplus net profit as the result of an increase in price[^3]. A non-eligible account with a non-tiered demurrage then converges to $\\frac{NP}{d}$. With the extra profit, it converges to $\\frac{NP + R}{d}$, but only for as long as the extra profit keeps coming in. As soon as prices drop again, the account balance converges to the new, and lower, $\\frac{NP + R'}{d}$. Both buildup of monetary capital in the account and capital drain as a result of reduced profit is dependent on $d.$ Higher $d$ leads to both a faster buildup and a faster drain of monetary capital for the supplier. The result is that the best strategy for the supplier would be to invest the extra profit rather quickly. This dynamic might result in a price tempering effect, even when demand exceeds production.  \n",

    "Charging demurrage at fixed intervals, for example at the end of each month, could result in a ‘hot potato’ effect. Individuals and organizations might try to get rid of excess money by paying bills early. This effect occurred in Wörgl. From 1932 to 1933, under the supervision of newly appointed mayor Michael Unterguggenberger, the town introduced a new currency based on the work of Silvio Gessell (Champ, 2008; Gessel, 1958; Svensson and Westermark, 2020). The currency implemented demurrage that is comparable to the demurrage introduced in this paper. The result was that residents started paying their taxes early in order to avoid demurrage fees on the money they were holding.\n",

This can, for eligible accounts, be combined with partial $GI$, resulting in a partial $NGI$ at each transaction.

The partial demurrage/$GI$ would then be calculated over the time since the last transaction.\n",

    "As mentioned in the introduction, the current use of complementary currencies is limited. This can be partially explained by the fact that most people do not see the value of adding the complexity of using multiple currencies to their life, but it also has a legal, and technical, reason. In the euro zone, the only legal currency is the euro. Taxes can only be paid in euros, and where complementary currencies are tolerated, income in these alternative currencies is converted to its value in euros, and taxed in euros.  \n",
    "The technical reason for this is that, should complementary currencies become too popular, they would threaten the stability of the current, post-Keynesian money supply model. The reasoning to support this statement goes as follows: a significant increase in the use of complementary currencies would reduce the need for Euro's, with less lending as a result. This introduces the danger of a diminishing money stock, which leads to the same, potentially destabilizing, scenario as that of a slowing economy (5.1.4).  \n",

With the proposed model that mode of operation is not advised since it would lead to a loss of currency stock. The exchange agency would need accounts for every type of currency it offers. Because the exchange agency is not an individual, it would not receive $GI$ on any of their accounts. Therefore, reserves would dwindle rapidly unless profit margins on exchanges exceed demurrage fees on every account. This could result in a high cost for currency exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative way to implement currency exchange in the proposed model is to grant exchange agencies the power to create and destroy money according to exchange rates. Transactions would only be allowed to be executed in pairs and on the accounts of their customers. Creation of one type of currency must be paired by the destruction of another type of currency according to the going exchange rate. This would eliminate the need for currency reserves and even the necessity to hold accounts for every currency. The profit for the exchange agency is then, through this mechanism, converted in the currency of the exchange office's account which is determined by the country they are operating from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exchange rates could be determined by the financial markets as it happens today, but, due to the fact that the money stock can be calculated, a mathematically determined exchange rate can also be introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, this exchange rate could be based on the $telo$'s of the implementations. Let $telo_1$ be the $telo$ for parameters $GI_1$ and $d_1$ and let $telo_2$ be the $telo$ for parameters $GI_2$ and $d_2$. Then the exchange rate $E_{C_1 C_2}$ from $C_1$ to $C_2$ can be expressed as follows:\n",

    "Another way to mathematically calculate the exchange rates between two countries would be to base it on the actual money stock $M$ divided by the number of eligible accounts, $|A_{GI}|$, since this represents the average buying power per citizen. This also takes the fluctuating money stock into account that can arise when demurrage-free buffers and/or demurrage tiers are implemented.\n",

However, none of the above methods include the effect of the speed at which the money stock reacts to changes, either through injections or removals of money, as handled in section 3. The effect of this speed on the value of a currency falls outside the scope of this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question arises whether currency exchange would introduce a way to avoid high demurrage rates in one currency by converting it to another currency. If an exchange from a currency with high demurrage to a currency with low demurrage would lead to profit when that low demurrage currency is converted back into the high demurrage currency at a later point in time, then this would create an incentive for currency conversion into lower demurrage currencies. However, in both the financial market scenario and the mathematical scenario this might be avoided. In a financial market scenario, high demand in low demurrage currencies would most likely raise the price of these currencies and eliminate the financial advantage. In a mathematical scenario, these potential profit gains might be calculated and used to adjust the exchange rates in such a way that they are eliminated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to avoid demurrage evasion is through legislation. Economic actors can, through new laws, be restricted to only having accounts in their country of residence/operation and thereby be forced to receive revenue in their national currency. Determining the feasibility of such legislation is outside the scope of this paper.  \n",

    "* Country $A$ annually exports goods and services to country $B$ for a total amount of $EX_A$ in currency $C_A$.\n",
    "* Country $B$ annually exports goods and services to country $A$ for a total amount of $EX_B$ in currency $C_B$.\n",

    "While structural international trade deficits/surpluses alter the money stock in countries, and thus can have an effect on inflation, this change is bounded by the amount of money created through $GI$ in the country with the structural deficit. The maximum amount of money that can be continuously transferred from the country with the structural deficit to the country with the structural surplus converges to the total amount of money created through $GI$. This amount can temporarily be higher, but that would eventually deplete the money stock in the country with the deficit, thereby limiting any further transfers to the amount created through $GI$ each period. This would result in an elevated money stock in the country with the surplus, and thus likely result in inflation. However, since the increase in money stock is bounded, any inflation caused by this rise in money stock would be temporary. Determining the magnitude of the inflation, and the time it would take to return to zero, requires further research."

    "Current business models, where businesses acquire large quantities of capital through loans that they then pay off with the income procured from production by the acquired capital, do not fit well within the proposed model. Producers of large capital assets would potentially receive large amounts at irregular intervals. In the current context, this monetary capital can either be saved or invested. The latter is still a viable option in the proposed model, but holding it in the organization's accounts would accrue demurrage costs, making it a less attractive option. Alternatives, which are a better fit with the proposed model, are either business-to-business lease contracts or product as a service contracts where the producer remains the owner of the product and takes care of any maintenance and energy costs related to it. The latter has already been applied by Thomas Rau in his RAU office in Amsterdam (Peters, 2011). In both cases, the transfer of large amounts of money would be converted into regular payments over time. The advantage for the buyer is that they do not need to have large amounts of money available for the purchase/hire. The advantage for the seller is that they do not need to deal with large sums sitting in accounts that are drained by demurrage, and they have an income stream that is far more predictable.\n",

Rescuing these organizations is often seen as a better option than letting the organization go bankrupt and having many of their employees becoming dependent on unemployment benefits. However, with the proposed model, these people's income is not solely dependent on their job income.

Even when large amounts only sit in an account for a very short period of time before they are used for buying new financial products, they can still result in rather high demurrage costs, especially when transactional demurrage is implemented. Therefore, it is highly likely that the dynamics of financial markets would undergo changes. New investment models would probably see the light of day. One such possible investment model could be a 'postponed return' model. The idea is that an investor puts money in an investment, rather than loose it to demurrage, and gets their return on investment after several years instead of immediately. For example when they retire and their income is reduced. For this type of investment to pay off, long-term sustainable business plans would be required.\n",

    "When adding the optional demurrage-free buffer to the model, a new type of investment might be created: lending out parts of ones' demurrage free buffer. When (partially) lending out one's demurrage free buffer, ownership would remain with the lender and contractual options for retrieval need to be set up. This type of investment provides businesses with corporate demurrage-free buffers, which helps them build financial reserves. The incentives for engaging with this type of investment might be broader than the mostly financial incentives existing today. Businesses could offer a wide range of advantages in return or people might 'invest' in organizations they value. The exact form this would take needs to be investigated further, but it clearly creates new opportunities."

    "### 6.10 Government finances  \n",
    "When implementing the model, a number of questions arise around the workings and funding of the government. The most prominent one would be what type of account(s) government institutions would hold. In the core model, these would be accounts without $GI$ and with demurrage. This is prohibitive against creating financial reserves. Therefore, collection of taxes would most likely shift towards more frequent collections of smaller sums. Another solution would be to only collect taxes when expenses need to be made. This would eliminate the need for accounts and would introduce a mechanism where taxes are collected and immediately spent. Large expenditures would be hard to finance with this option. On the other hand, there exists a real possibility that large transfers of money would be converted to monetary streams over time, which would be needed to make this solution feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the bounded nature of account balances, the proposed model might open doors for a tax system based on monetary wealth rather than on income. This could be implemented through a mechanism similar to the demurrage levied on the accounts. Two possible implementations are proposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) A fixed tax rate, collected in the same way as demurrage but deposited on government accounts rather than being destroyed. These government accounts would need to function like non $GI$ entitled accounts in order to maintain systemic integrity of the proposed model. This would result in some loss of tax money to demurrage if it sits unspent in government accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) A fixed tax rate, collected on special government accounts that are not subject to demurrage. This would allow the buildup of reserves, but also introduces potential instability to the model. Large sums of money could be accumulated this way and spent all at once into the economy, resulting is a sudden rise of the money stock. As has been shown in 3.1.1, the model would automatically correct this over time, but the sudden rise of the money stock could result in temporary inflation.  \n",
    "It could be imagined that limits would be set to these reserve accounts. When these limits are exceeded, one of two options could be implemented:  \n",
    "* The surplus money could be destroyed.\n",
    "* The surplus money could be redistributed among taxpayers. This could even be done in a proportional way where the amount one receives would be relative to the amount of taxes they paid. The amount returned would then be subtracted from the amount paid so that the calculation for the next redistribution would remain fair.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Both options would cause some fluctuation of the money stock, but since taxes and the reserve boundaries can be managed, the level of fluctuation is both bounded and calculable.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) On-demand taxes with an upper bound. Periodic governance cost could be determined as percentage $g$ of the total money stock, the latter being derivable from $GI$ and $d$. If a safety margin is taken into account, this periodic percentage $g$ could be set as an upper bound. Each period, up to $g * B(a)$ is transferred to the governance accounts from each account. However, only the amount needed for that period is transferred. If the safety buffer is large enough it means that every period a fraction $F$, where $0 \\le F \\le 1$, of $g * B(a)$ is transferred from each account. In that case, the governance accounts do not necessarily need to be accounts. They can be mere transfer channels from taxpayers accounts to the accounts of those doing work for the government. With a setup like this, no tax money is lost to demurrage, at least not while sitting in government accounts. This setup also avoids money stock fluctuations due to taxing.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of a net guaranteed income for all citizens, numerous costs can be cut. This is similar to what has been researched for basic income scenarios, but it goes one step further. With the proposed model, no taxes need to be collected to fund the net guaranteed income since this is the source of money creation in the proposed model."

Although it is beyond the scope of the paper to make a full analytical comparison between MMT and the proposed model, proposing a new general-purpose monetary model warrants at least a high-level comparison between the two models.  \n",
    "The main difference between the two models lies in the way in which money is brought into circulation and how it is taken out of circulation. With MMT, money creation through lending is supplemented with bringing money into circulation through government spending, and money destruction through paying off bank debt is supplemented by taking money out of circulation through taxes. With the proposed model, the money creation/destruction cycle through lending and paying off loans is abandoned and replaced by creating debt-free money that is deposited on every living individual's account in the form of a guaranteed income and destroying money through demurrage fees on all existing accounts. The latter results in a more predictable money stock than what is proposed by MMT. It also puts the controls at the level of monetary policy and not, as MMT does, at the political level. Although, in all fairness, in the proposed model it is also possible to initiate money creation from the political level as explained in 5.1.5. However, this only holds true for bringing money into circulation. Taking money out of circulation is taken care of by demurrage and is governed through monetary policy and not by political decisions. This has a distinct advantage over the taxation method proposed by MMT. Monetary policy is far less prone to being influenced by lobbying groups than political decisions, and thus provides a more stable and trustworthy means of taking surplus money out of circulation.  \n",
    "Another major difference is that MMT does not provide financial security in the form of a guaranteed income, which the proposed model does.  \n",
    "Additionally, all the effects discussed above that would be caused by the combination of a guaranteed income with demurrage are either lacking from MMT or would require a complex setup that is subject to political volatility."

This average participation level can be seen as the backing of the average share of the money stock per person. Should the population shrink, then the logical consequence is that, with equal production means, the total output of that economy shrinks too.

    "\n",
    "It has been demonstrated that the proposed model is capable of providing a solid monetary base, necessary for supporting an economy. The inherent predictability and self-stabilizing nature of the money stock within calculable boundaries, dependent on parameters that can be set through monetary policy, is a clear improvement over the unpredictable and hard to manage post-Keynesian money supply model that supports our current day economy. So is the reduction of possible causes for inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-stabilizing nature of the model allows for large, government-funded, social and sustainability projects with minor risks to monetary stability and without creating large government deficits. The question that remains to be answered is what happens to price levels in the time frame the money stock rises and falls due to the financing nature of these projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamics of the proposed model intuitively incentivize long-term thinking and sustainable business planning. This is further supported by the likely incentive for investment schemes with a postponed return on investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in net guaranteed income eradicates extreme poverty, at a minimum, and provides everyone with financial security. It gives employees better bargaining power for finding meaningful jobs with decent work conditions, thereby contributing to the overall well-being of society. The built-in financial security creates more financial breathing space for beginning entrepreneurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large organizations in trouble do not need to be bailed out because of the jobs they provide. Individuals can always rely on the guaranteed income provided by the model, without the cost current unemployment schemes bring with them. Because of this, the free market gives small players a chance to compete with large organizations on quality of product and service. This might enhance overall quality and innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a demurrage-free buffer to the model potentially creates a new form of investing. Partial demurrage-free buffers can be lent out to organizations, thereby providing them with demurrage-free buffers of their own. What the return for the investor might be needs to be researched. This return might not necessarily need to be in the form of money, but could take the form of non-monetary value such as good working conditions, quality products and service, prime customer contracts, ... Especially cooperative organization structures form an ideal context for this type of investment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that the full range of the impact of the proposed model can-not yet be known, and more research is definitely needed to fill in the unknowns. However, first conclusions indicate this could be a viable replacement for the current post-Keynesian money supply model. It provides better monetary stability, is not dependent on the state of the economy, and supports incentives to build a more sustainable economy. Central Bank Digital Currencies could provide an opportunity to introduce this model alongside the existing post-Keynesian model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this paper puts a very ambitious proposal on the table, which is clearly outside the boundaries of most current economic thinking, it is in our best interest to at least consider the possibilities this might create. As Nelson Mandela said in his 2001 speech: everything is impossible until it's done."
